# MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model or pattern within the Hadoop framework that is used to access big data stored in the Hadoop File System (HDFS).

MapReduce is important in data engineering because it allows efficient processing of large datasets by breaking them into smaller parts and distributing the work across multiple machines. It provides scalability, fault tolerance, a simplified programming model, and cost-effective solutions. Overall, MapReduce enables data engineers to handle big data effectively, extract insights, and make data-driven decisions at scale.
